        <p class="paragraph-intro">
          Priyanka Vekariya is my name. My life path has been anything but
          predictable. In India, I earned a bachelor's degree in accounting and
          finance. After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I interned for three
          years with a chartered accounting business. My auditing, taxation, and
          accounting knowledge. However, after years of working there, I rapidly
          recognized that it was not my type of area or lifestyle. I believe
          that one's work should be meaningful or have an impact on one's life.
          I've been highly immersed in Computer Science courses for the previous
          two years, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I'm finding that
          Computer Science is much more than just learning a programming
          language. That is why I chose to return to school and obtain a
          degree.That's why I decided to go back to school and acquire the
          necessary skill set to become successful in my career.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-intro">
          I applied for and was accepted to Boston University's master of
          science in software development (MSSD) program. I have finished four
          MSSD courses. Between all of this, I've learned a lot from this
          Master's degree. Cooking is something I enjoy doing in my spare time.
          Almost all Indian vegetarian recipes are now second nature to me. In
          real life, I appreciate people who do yoga and running. I am a web
          developer that enjoys designing visually appealing websites. I have a
          business background and a strong desire to learn new technology.Â

          While working as a professional photographer documenting adventurous
