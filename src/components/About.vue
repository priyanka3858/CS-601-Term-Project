          My name is Priyanka vekariya. I graduated in Accounting and Finance
          from India. After completing my Bechaloree degree, I did three years
          of internship in a chartered accountant firm. My expertise in audit,
          taxation, and accounting. But, after working for years, I realized
          that being an Accountant is not a skill but, rather, practice. For the
          last two years, I've been heavily involved in Computer Science courses
          by acquiring knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I learn that
          Computer Science is not just learning some programing language; it's
          much more than that. That's why I decided to go back to school and
          acquire the necessary skill set to become successful in my career.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I have applied and got admission for a master of science in software
          development(MSSD) at Boston University. I have completed four Courses
          in MSSD. Between this, I have learned so much from this Master's
          program. In my personal life, I am passionate about cooking. I have
          learned almost all Indian vegetarian dishes. I also admire doing yoga
          and running in real life.
