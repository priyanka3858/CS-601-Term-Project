          <h2>My Favorite Travel Locations</h2>
          <p>
            This div features some of my favorite travel destinations. I enjoy
            seeing areas that are both beautiful and distinctive. Hiking and
            camping were also two of my greatest joys. I've been to about ten
            states in the United States. Here's a list of some of my favorite
            places to visit. At some point, these magnificent destinations made
            me feel. Let me give you a taste of what makes them all so special.

          <h2>New york Time square</h2>
          <p>
            TIME SQUARE In New York is a famous landmark in the United States. I
            find New York to be too hectic for me, particularly while visiting
            Times Square. Especially at night, the views of all the lights in
            Time Square are spectacular. Time Square is a very remarkable site
            to visit and the heart of New York because of the crowds, the
            spectacular perspective, and the lights.
