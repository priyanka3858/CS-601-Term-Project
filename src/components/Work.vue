          I have personally learned basic knowledge of python, java, javascript,
          react, HTML, and CSS by watching a tutorial on Programming with Mosh
          on youtube. I have recently watched an HTML and CSS tutorial on
          Programming with Mosh.I have atteched an HTML and CSS tutorial video
          here.Programming with Mosh has a website where a bunch, of course,
          will help you better understand every course; Here is the link to the
          Website of Programming with Mosh:

          On Freecodecamp.org, I first began learning basic HTML and CSS and
          creating a few projects. I designed a Daily Planner in Python after
          enrolling in Boston University's Master of Science in Software
          Development (MSSD). After that, I learned about the Flas web framework
          and constructed a Python app for a Crypto pricing list. The following
          JAVA program is a password manager that saves passwords and usernames
          from many websites on the internet.Â A Basic To-Do List React was also
          made. I'll also add additional functionality to my To-Do List app,
          such as a database and hosting a web app in Vercel. I learned about
          data structure algorithms and software design techniques as well.
